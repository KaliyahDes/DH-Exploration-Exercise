### Finding an Archive:

When I opened the various resources [here](https://diaryindex.com/digitized-diaries/), my first thought was _what topic would I want to explore in my DH Exploration Exercise? Do I want to find something that I already have some knowledge of? Or should I dive into something completely new to me?_ I then began looking through various diaries, reading a few pages here and there. One that interested me at first was [Maria Madi’s Diaries](https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn50967#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&xywh=-275%2C-47%2C1133%2C888). Madi’s diaries contained a personal account of her experiences as a non-Jewish individual protecting a Jewish boy. I thought this was such an interesting topic and historical experience! But, out of curiosity, I continued to look through some more diaries and found myself reading various pages of [Abby Bright’s diary](http://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223662). While I found Madi’s diary and overall experiences to be so enticing, important, and powerful, I questioned Bright. I continued to read and read with the consistent question of _why was Abby Bright so significant?_ Clearly, Maria Madi was observably significant for her heroic acts of helping a young Jewish boy hide throughout the holocaust. However, Bright’s significance isn’t so apparent. As a challenge to myself (and a curiosity that wouldn’t go away) I decided it would be interesting to explore Bright’s diary to uncover what made her significant enough to have her diary digitized with someone as significant as Maria Madi. 

### Struggling with Wget…Again (although, it was a challenge I had yet encountered):

I started off my work attempting to retrieve the content of Abbie Bright’s diary from the web using Wget. Yet, I was experiencing some struggles. I was able to create a folder for the diaries through the terminal with no problem. However, for some reason, I could not download the actual diary entries using the code `$ wget` followed by the URL. My initial thought was to relax, take a deep breath and try again; and when I did, it **still** didn’t work. My heart began to beat fast and I knew I needed to take a step back from doing digital history and focus on some different work. I gave myself the night and came back with a fresh mindset: _I’m going to accomplish what I can and be proud of all my efforts. **But** I will not give up and put myself down_. This is a work in progress; I’ve learned so much since the start of the term. I have completed and achieved things (technologically) that I would have never believed I could do. With a new mindset and a ticking clock, a dived back in. 
I started off re-reading the Wget tutorial and spotted the section _Using Wget with a List of URLs_. So, I followed the guidance of the tutorial and was able to successfully retrieve Abbie Bright’s diary from the web to my device using Wget. I’d like to note that Skylar Richards and I worked together with Wget, similar to how we did in Part Two, which definitely helped speed up the process. Like they always say, _two heads are better than one!_
I was able to fix this issue by creating a new file and pasting the URLs into it in Atom. I then saved the file as `urs.txt`. Following, I placed that into my file labelled _wget-abbiebrightdiaries_. I then placed the command `$ wget -i urls.txt -r --no-parent -nd -w 2 --limit-rate=100k` Into the terminal. I then saw something beautiful; the diaries were retrieved. **Another success!**
 

### Jumping into Voyant 

Now I was ready to dive into Voyant; one of my favourite tools that I will carry into the rest of my studies. When I placed the Abbie Bright file into Voyant I hit an error:

I felt like I had hit a brick wall. How could this not have worked? All that effort to get Wget to retrieve Bright’s diary, and yet Voyant isn’t able to read it. I felt devastated, but knew I had to continue to push forward (not only for a good grade for the class, but also to prove to myself that I can get over hurdles and still achieve things, even if I encounter difficulties). So, with the help of a fellow classmate, Skylar Richards, I was able to figure out that I could copy the text version of Abbie Bright’s diary on the [Kansas Memory](https://www.kansasmemory.org/item/223662) website and past that URL into Voyant. The sense of relief I felt with such success was euphoric. It felt as though nothing could top that feeling. My thoughts were: _I’m still going! I’m still making it through, and I can see the finish line from here!_ 

Voyant is such a useful digital tool, since it is able to show you the most common words in a large text. When using Voyant for the first time in Part Three, I looked at a very large piece of work through distant reading; this process allowed me to observe how different arguments and understandings can be made by observing data, words, and sentences from a distance, rather than taking a look at the entire text. Voyant presents a simple and visual set of trends so that the reader can use such trends to create a distant reading argument about the overall work. In Part Three, we took a look at Tim Hitchock’s [“Big Data for Dead People”](https://historyonics.blogspot.com/2013/12/big-data-for-dead-people-digital.html), which articulates the important difference between distant and close reading. He draws on Ben Schmidt’s analysis of the _Mad Men_ dialogue, which is made up of comparing the “language used by the scriptwriters to the corpus of text published in that particular year drawn from Google books” (Hitchcock, 2013). Hitchcock continues by saying, “Schmidt's work depends upon [...] the existence of something like Google Books [...] [which] can change the character of how we ‘read’ a sentence, a word, a phrase, a genre – by giving a norm against which to compare it” (Hitchcock, 2013). Distant reading is very different compared to the general process of doing historical research: read a text multiple times, analyze it, explore primary and secondary sources that connect to it, and then create an argument based on what has been read and analyzed. Using tools like Voyant makes this process much more simple and can create new and sufficient arguments about texts. Now I was able to use it to explore Bright’s diary entries. Using Voyant I was able to observe all this straightforward information:

### Voyant Observations: Rising Assumptions

 I began exploring Bright’s diary a little more in-depth through Voyant. As you can see above, some of the most common words are “home”, “went”, “came”, “men”, “Mr.”, “Night”, and “Day”. This sparked so many ideas and assumptions about Abbie Bright. She must be adventurous and love to travel based on the common travel word trends (i.e., “went”, came”, “home”, “day”, and “night”). I also observed an overbearing reference to male-specific language and words. The common words, “men”, “Mr”, “brother”, and “boys” suggests that the environment in which Abbie lives in is male dominant, possibly patriarchal, and has significant trends of male dominance. The lack of words used to describe females such as “women”, “girls”, and “woman”, to me suggests that women were not viewed as important individuals to discuss and were not given much authority during this period. It also suggests to me that Abbie holds the historical significance of going against patriarchal control and male-dominance views, and overall holds the feminist voice throughout the telling of her experiences, even if she is not aware. 

### Exploring Specific Passages of Bright’s Diary:

I went through various passages from the Diary and observed through close reading that Abbie was most definitely a traveller. I was therefore convinced that Abbie’s significance resided in her ability to break from the male-dominant expectation during this period, in which women were expected to be stationary and should avoid adventurous behaviour. Here are a few specific quotes that raised such ideas:

“We left home the 23 of Aug. 1870, and after stopping at Reading, and Columbus, reached Hirams the 2nd of Sept.  Mary Klop was not in Reading – so I did not see her, but W.M. [Achenbath], who was teaching at the Normal, came down to Aunt Kittie Greenes, and spent an evening with me – and we decided to correspond while I was West” (Bright, 1868-1921). 
“Largely through sister Rebecca’s planning it was arranged that I should go to the Keystone State Normal at Kutztin, some 18 miles from Reading [...] Then I went back to the Keystone Normal for the Spring time.  I found many changes.  W.T. taught mathematics. Miss Keof roomed with me” (Bright, 1868-1921). 


Through further investigation, Abby did **a lot of travelling**! On August 23rd, Bright began her travelling adventures, which is the date she first left home. She notes in her diary that her Brother, Philip, lived in Kansas City, and she began her travels here from her home in Pennsylvania to attend school. Then she travelled through Topeka with her brother, then Cottonwood, to El Dorado, then from Eldorado to Agusta, and finishing in Wichita. After observing all the travelling Bright did, I realized how interesting it would be to map out her travels, see what she did during them, and explore pictures of such places (whether they be representative of that time or more modern times). So, I felt that creating an in-depth google Map would be an excellent digital tool to map out Bright’s historical travels.  


### Victorian Women and Abbie Bright’s Subtle Detest Against Victorian Norms and Expectations:

According to Joseph W. Snell, Abbie Bright was significantly different from the average Victorian woman; “She was a woman with a sense of propriety but also with a determined mind and a yen for adventure” (1971). Drawing from previous knowledge of the Victorian era that I have accumulated from past courses, women during this time were expected to stay home, care for the family, and overall demonstrate a domestic lifestyle. Evidently, Abbie came from a well-off White family, as her family owned quite a lot of land and property. So, she was able to carry out her travels throughout the west by using the excuse of visiting family or travelling with family. A rather interesting and important section I observed within her diary was the fact that, while she was travelling to Augusta, she was accompanied by fifteen to sixteen passengers, all of which were male (Bright, 1868-1921). She further articulates that she attempted to be “dignified” and was treated with courtesy by these men. This raised some questions such as: _was she able to travel with all-male passengers and succeed in her desire to travel because of her high-class status and race?_ Earlier when she travelled to Cottonwood, Abbie voiced that the hotel she was staying at was “the hardest looking place [she] ever stopped at, with so many idle men lounging around” (Bright, 1868-1921). Here, it is evident that Abbie sees an importance in class and wealth; she observed her hotel area as dingy and surrounded by impoverished, ‘lazy’ individuals. Overall, while Abbie was an upper-class woman with the advantage to succeed in travelling as a Victorian woman, she still pushes the boundaries of her time; she successfully travelled around West Kansas during a time in which women were expected to be subordinate and domestic individuals. 

### Using Google Maps as a Visual for Bright’s Success

I created a visual collection of all the data and information I collected about Abbie Bright’s travel across west Kansas using google maps, which can be found [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1rEHeXBJnq-kNA27ZJgvI-c-WltIv8Lc&usp=sharing). I began my map by locating the early locations of Abbie’s life, which include her birth location and schooling places. Alongside these places, I discuss her decent childhood, but how it was still filled with Victorian expectations for women, such as females being the caregivers (which is evident when Abbie assisted in the hospital, alongside the other women in her family early in her life). I then began mapping out the trail of her travels from Kansas to Wichita. In each location/destination, I discuss some important notes Abbie makes about her experience in such places or travelling from one place to the next. From a personal perception, historical accounts of travel and maps have been reserved for men; in elementary, high school, and even post-secondary education, students are always shown historical men’s travel processes and maps associated with them. Truthfully, when I think of a historical map, I think about the adventures of a man. In Sharon Leon’s article, [“Returning Women to the History of Digital History,”](http://www.6floors.org/bracket/2016/03/07/returning-women-to-the-history-of-digital-history/) she discusses how men have made up most of the history concerning digital history, which truly silences historical women. Therefore, using the Google Maps tool to create a map of Abbie’s travels allows for a new perception of male-dominate aspects of society (and history) and allows for female, historical women to begin breaking down those barriers that silence and limit the exposure of their historical significance. 

I wanted to make a Twine game to go alongside the map I made, in which a player could play the role of Abbie and make particular choices that would either stump her ability to travel around Kansas or aid in her success. Doing so would demonstrate how particular actions by White women during the Victorian era would be seemingly simple but have a significant effect on the experiences and lives of White women. But, as the clock is ticking, I am _slowly_ running out of time for creating and practicing digital history (for this class). Perhaps I’ll be able to take the new digital skills I have acquired in this class and apply them to a future digital history course, where I can continue the exploration of Abbie Bright and her diary.
